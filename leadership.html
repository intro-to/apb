        <h1>Leadership and personal development:</h1>
        <ul>
          <h2>7 seven habits of high effective person</h2>
          <h2>Be Proactive:</h2>
          <li>
            Effective individuals take responsibility for their actions and
            choices. They understand that they have the power to control their
            responses to external circumstances and don't let circumstances
            dictate their behavior. Being proactive means focusing on what you
            can influence or change, rather than dwelling on things beyond your
            control.
            <h2>Begin with the End in Mind:</h2>
            Highly effective people have a clear sense of purpose and direction.
            They set goals based on their values and vision for the future, and
            they work towards those goals with intentionality. Beginning with
            the end in mind involves envisioning your desired outcomes and then
            aligning your actions with that vision.
            <h2>Put First Things First:</h2>
            Effective individuals prioritize their time and energy on activities
            that align with their goals and values. They distinguish between
            what is important and what is merely urgent, focusing on
            high-priority tasks that contribute to long-term success. This habit
            emphasizes time management, organization, and goal-setting.
            <h2>Think Win-Win:</h2>
            Successful people seek mutually beneficial outcomes in their
            interactions and relationships. They believe in abundance rather
            than scarcity and strive to create win-win solutions that satisfy
            all parties involved. Thinking win-win requires empathy,
            collaboration, and a mindset of abundance.
            <h2>Seek First to Understand,</h2>
            Then to Be Understood: Effective communicators listen empathetically
            and seek to understand others before expressing their own
            perspectives. They practice active listening, suspending judgment
            and genuinely trying to see the world from the other person's point
            of view. By understanding others first, they can communicate more
            effectively and build stronger relationships.
            <h2>Synergize:</h2>
            Highly effective people value collaboration and teamwork. They
            recognize that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and
            actively seek out opportunities to leverage the strengths and
            talents of others. Synergy involves combining individual efforts to
            achieve outcomes that are greater than what could be achieved alone.
            <h2>Sharpen the Saw:</h2>
            Effective individuals prioritize self-care and continuous
            improvement. They recognize the importance of renewing their
            physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being regularly.
            Sharpening the saw involves activities such as exercise, learning,
            reflection, and relaxation that rejuvenate and energize individuals,
            enabling them to perform at their best over the long term.
